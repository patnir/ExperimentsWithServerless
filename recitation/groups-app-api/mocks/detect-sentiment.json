As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character.

The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically.
